- 👋 Hi, I’m @syversen86
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and Javascript, particularly the p5.js framework.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of code but not trying to be an expert. I am also currently going to school. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Javascript projects, but I'm not that much of a help.
